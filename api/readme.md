# Flask API

### Overview

This Flask API serves as the communication bridge between the mobile application and the data processing components of the project. It facilitates the exchange of data between the local machine, which runs the machine learning model and stores necessary information, and the mobile application. By using this API, the mobile app can access real-time data and configurations from the local server.

Run this api through flaskapi.py
