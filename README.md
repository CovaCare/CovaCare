# CovaCare

CovaCare (Computer Vision Accident Care) is an intelligent safety system that uses in-home cameras to detect slips, falls, and prolonged inactivity. When an incident occurs, the system instantly identifies it and alerts emergency contacts, ensuring a fast response and reducing the risk of serious injury.

In Canada, falls are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalizations and deaths among individuals aged 65 and older, yet many go unnoticed for hours. While traditional alerting systems help, they rely on users pressing a button or wearing a device, which can be impractical or easily forgotten.

CovaCare eliminates these limitations by providing continuous, AI-driven monitoring that detects emergencies in real-time. It operates entirely in the background and automatically sends SMS alerts when needed. Additionally, the system runs entirely on a local server, ensuring all video data is kept private.

Designed for the elderly and disabled, CovaCare enhances safety while preserving independence, offering peace of mind for both those it protects and their loved ones.
