# CovaCare

This project focuses on the development of a computer vision-based accident detection system aimed at enhancing safety for the elderly and disabled within residential settings. This system will use advanced computer vision and machine learning technology to detect slips, falls, and prolonged inactivity in real time. Upon detection of an incident, the system will promptly notify designated emergency contacts, ensuring timely intervention and reducing the risk of severe injuries or fatalities.
