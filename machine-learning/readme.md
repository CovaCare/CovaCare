# Machine Learning

CovaCare features a specialized fall and inactivity detection model, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to enhance safety. Our system uses computer vision and machine learning to provide real-time monitoring and emergency detection.

Start monitoring:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Fall Detection

Our fall detection model is an LSTM classifier, trained using the following datasets:

- [URFD](https://fenix.ur.edu.pl/~mkepski/ds/uf.html)
- [GMDCSA24](https://github.com/ekramalam/GMDCSA24-A-Dataset-for-Human-Fall-Detection-in-Videos)
- [UMontreal](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~labimage/Dataset/)
- [Le2i](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tuyenldvn/falldataset-imvia)
- [High Quality Fall Simulation Data](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/advise/datasets#High%20Quality%20Fall%20Simulation%20Data)
